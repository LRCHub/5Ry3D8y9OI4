I couldn't believe, moon like a shadow
Move like a shadow, affects me
Take a sight to head
Fetch a pretty man
To get him down to kiss me

In a time an a place, far as far at sea
Sick as shit, don't touch me

Lilac in hand
Lilac in hand
Hesitation

I couldn't believe, moon like a shadow
Move like a shadow, affects me
In a time an a place, far as far at sea
Sick as shit, don't touch me

Lilac in hand
Lilac in hand
Hesitation
