Dan, Dan, Menthol Dan.

Dan, Dan, Menthol Dan

My friend Dan, he was a courteous man.
There wasn't much he didn't understand.
He stood on the fringe of death;
All because the bad Macbeth,
The lilac hand of menthol Dan.

Dan, Dan, Menthol Dan.

Dan, Dan, Menthol Dan

We met Beth, she was a friend of mine.
She intreduced him to a life of crime.
He stood on a burning bridge;
All because he stole a fridge,
The lilac hand of menthol Dan.

Dan, Dan, Dan you don't understand
You've got the face of an angel
But your mine of a man.

Dan, Dan, Dan you don't understand
You've got the face of an angel
But your mine of a man.

Dan was goosed from his more nasty self.
He found the whole of life
And through it, he fell.
Deep into the hour of truth
Owned a house with a purple roof.
The lilac hand of menthol Dan.

Dan, Dan, Dan you don't understand
You've got the face of an angel
But your mine of a man.

Dan, Dan, Dan you don't understand
You've got the face of an angel
But your mine of a man.

Dan, Dan, Dan you don't understand
You've got the face of an angel
But your mine of a man.
